Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
Breadth-First Search Algorithm or BFS is the most widely utilized method. BFS is a graph traversal approach in which you start at a source node and layer by layer through the graph, analyzing the nodes directly related to the source node.
